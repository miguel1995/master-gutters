                <div>First, what is soffit and what is fascia?</div><br/>
                <div><strong>Soffit</strong> is the underside element of a building most commonly found under the
                    eaves
                    on the exterior of a house. The <strong>soffit</strong> extends from the side of the house to the edge of the
                    eave or
                    fascia.
                </div>
                
                <p>A <strong>"fascia board"</strong> is usually made out of wood but can also be metal or other materials, it caps the end of rafters outside a building and optionally it is used to hold gutters.</p>
                <div><strong>Why a house needs soffit or fascia?</strong></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The soffit and fascia protect your home from water damage while improving its appearance.</li>
                    <li>Eliminate extra costs for painting those hard-to-reach places, vinyl soffit will maintain its appearance for many years.</li>
                    <li>They control moisture and rotting problems inherent in eaves and overhangs.</li>
                    <li>Our aluminum materials (soffit and fascia) are .019 in thickness.</li>
                    <li>As with all our installations we warranty our workmanship to be free from
